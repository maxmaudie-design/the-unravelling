## WHAT THIS PROJECT IS

A long-form essay (currently ~11,200 words) tracing 4,000 years of social contract breakdowns and resets, written to understand contemporary political fracture. Directed by Max Maudie, former journalist, Alberta, Canada. AI collaboration (Claude) is transparent and will be part of the story.

**Publication plan:** Serialized on Substack with "director's commentary" showing the AI collaboration process. Personal framing: "Why I Stopped Trolling Alberta Separatists (And What I Learned About Social Collapse)."

**Core argument:** The "tribalism" and institutional collapse we're experiencing is what happens when a social contract dies and nothing replaces it. Meaningful resets only occur when horizontal friction (groups blaming each other) turns vertical (collective pressure on the system itself).

**The credit model:** The symphony conductor. Max didn't write the individual parts (the scholars did) and didn't play them (the AI did), but conducted the performance into a coherent whole. "Directed by" is accurate and honest.

## OUTSTANDING TASKS (PRIORITY ORDER)

### 🔴 CRITICAL — Must fix before publication
1. **Carney attribution** — The line "Any political project that offers only policy without purpose will lose to one that offers purpose without policy" appears unattributed in V1 and must be properly attributed to **Mark Carney** in V2. Verify exact source before adding.
2. **Trudeau contrast** — "Because it's 2015" to be added as the mirror image: *purpose without policy* vs Carney's *policy without purpose*. These should be contrasted explicitly in the essay.

### 🟡 CONTENT GAPS — Flagged for development
3. **Identity politics section** — Essay may be thin here. The key point: identity replaced geography as the organizing principle of community. V2's Section V touches this but may need more.
4. **Horizontal/vertical friction sourcing** — This concept traces to Piven and Cloward. Essay should acknowledge synthesis rather than claim originality.
5. **Canadian content / Alberta case study** — Essay is heavily US-focused. Alberta works as a live case study showing the horizontal/vertical friction dynamic isn't culturally specific to American racial politics. The same status-loss mechanism operates along regional and identity lines in Canada. See research notes below.
6. **Status loss as explicit mechanism** — Currently implicit in the essay. The PsyPost study (Feb 18, 2026) and Alberta research together suggest it deserves explicit treatment in Section V, distinct from both economic grievance and pure cultural anxiety.

### 🟢 PUBLICATION INFRASTRUCTURE — When essay is clean
7. **Launch post / methodology manifesto** — Publish THIS before the essay. ~500–1,000 words. Carney story is the centrepiece.
8. **Director's commentary** — See template below. Accompanies each serialized section.
9. **Mutual interviews** — Max interviews Claude; Claude interviews Max. Companion content, not a separate project.
10. **Reading list verification** — Already drafted in V2. Verify all titles before publication.

## PUBLICATION STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Clean the Essay
- Attribution audit (Carney fixed; check for anything else)
- Content gaps addressed (identity politics, Piven/Cloward credit, Canadian content, status loss)
- Final fact-check on all statistics

### Phase 2: Build the Frame
- Write the methodology manifesto (launch post)
- Draft the "How to Read This" introduction
- Prepare director's commentary for each section

### Phase 3: Launch
- Publish methodology manifesto first
- Serialize essay weekly, one section per installment
- Each installment = essay section + director's notes
- Comment section becomes part of the collaboration — readers can flag issues

### 🔲 Possible Editorial Angle — The Alberta Hook
"A former Alberta journalist uses 4,000 years of history to understand why his neighbours want to leave Canada."

## KEY INTELLECTUAL DECISIONS MADE

- **Horizontal/vertical friction** is the central analytical framework. Credited to Piven and Cloward; essay presents synthesis, not original discovery.
- **Scope caveat** is explicit: Western-centric, acknowledged as such.
- **Methodology** prioritizes empirical data over narrative.
- **Nostalgia narrative** is explicitly rejected on both left and right versions.
- **Four futures** framework: techno-feudalism, authoritarian consolidation, new social contract, long muddle.
- Essay resists calling for "restoration" of postwar bargain — its exclusions were features, not bugs.
- **Credit model settled:** "Directed by Max Maudie" — the symphony conductor framing.
- **Status loss as distinct mechanism** — neither pure economic grievance nor pure cultural anxiety, but perceived relative decline in standing. Documented in both US (racial hierarchy) and Alberta (regional hierarchy) contexts. Should be made explicit in Section V.
- **Wesley's "Western Alienation 2.0" framing** — current separatism is qualitatively different from historical western alienation. Old version: held back. New version: falling behind, needing to restore previous status. This distinction is central to the status loss argument.

**New sources identified Feb 18, 2026 session (not yet integrated into V2):**

- **Cooley, Brown-Iannuzzi et al.** (2026), "White Americans' feelings of being 'last place'..." *Advances in Psychology*. Peer-reviewed, longitudinal, census-weighted (n=506, 5 waves). Key finding: perceived racial status position — not objective income or education — predicts Trump support. ~15% of sample fit "last place (tied with Black Americans)" profile. Directly supports Section V's horizontal friction argument with fresh empirical data. DOI: 10.56296/aip00046

- **Jared Wesley** (University of Alberta, Professor of Political Science) — the central academic figure on Alberta separatism and western alienation. Multiple relevant works:
  - Commissioned paper for Public Order Emergency Commission — traces Alberta separatism and Freedom Convoy to "status loss, political tribalism, and the death of deference to traditional forms of authority."
  - "Western Alienation 2.0" (Substack, March 2025) — defines the qualitative shift: old alienation = held back; new alienation = falling behind, needing to restore previous status. Names three converging forces: industries recast as relics; Indigenous rights assertions challenging settler identity; DEI/multiculturalism experienced as threats to moral standing.
  - "Populism, Sovereignty, and Democracy in Alberta" (Substack, recent) — connects Alberta separatism to global right-wing populism, not just Canadian regional grievance.
  - Viewpoint Alberta surveys (with Berdahl, Young, Maroto, Snagovsky et al.) — longitudinal survey data on western alienation. Key finding: over 50% of Albertans now believe "the province's best days are behind it" — historically unprecedented. Wesley: "signals that this new round of western alienation is different than it has been in the past."
  - Snagovsky, Maroto & Wesley, "White Identity and Western Alienation in Alberta" (2022, PPSA) — working paper on racial dimensions of western alienation.
  - Wesley runs the **Common Ground** initiative at U of A, which produced the Goertz focus group research.
  - **Wesley's Substack:** https://drjaredwesley.substack.com — active, worth monitoring.

- **Tamara Krawchenko**, The Conversation (Feb 15, 2026) — "As Alberta separatists court the U.S., prosperity is fuelling a sovereigntist turn." Key line: Alberta's anger "stems from believing it matters a great deal and is nonetheless disrespected." Three-way collision: cultivated grievance politics + self-inflicted fiscal vulnerability + energy transition threatening regional identity.

- **Maclean's**, "Alberta's New Separatists" (2025) — Alberta median family incomes were 30% above national average before 2014 oil crash, now only 15% above. Still richer, but the gap narrowed. Perceived falling = political fuel.

- **Common Ground / Samuel Goertz** focus group research (2025) — 21 focus groups, ~200 Albertans. "Joe" (composite typical Albertan) feels disrespected by Ontario, Quebec, Vancouver. Not poorer — disrespected. Separatism used as leverage ("Quebec Playbook"), not genuine desire to leave.

## RESEARCH NOTES: STATUS LOSS — US AND ALBERTA PARALLEL

**The core paradox in Alberta:** Objectively Canada's wealthiest province. Yet hosts Canada's most intense separatist movement. Diagnostic of status grievance, not economic grievance.

**Wesley's key distinction — "Western Alienation 2.0":**
- Old western alienation: Alberta feels *held back* from reaching its potential. Underlying optimism intact.
- New western alienation: Alberta feels it is *falling behind* and needs to *restore* its previous status. Optimism gone — majority now believe the province's best days are behind it.
- This shift from "held back" to "falling behind" is the moment the grievance turns existential. It's also the moment horizontal anger intensifies.

**The three-way identity erosion (Wesley):**
1. Industries that built the West recast as relics and environmental problems — not just economic threat but moral delegitimisation
2. Indigenous rights assertions challenge the settler identity underlying western alienation
3. DEI and multiculturalism experienced as threats to what it means to be honourable

This is status loss operating at the level of *moral* standing, not just economic standing.

**The parallel mechanism (US vs Alberta):**
- US (Cooley et al.): White Americans who *perceive* themselves tied with Black Americans at the bottom of the racial hierarchy — not the actually poorest — are most likely to support Trump.
- Alberta (Wesley/Viewpoint): Province still richer than rest of Canada, but gap has narrowed. Majority now feel best days are behind them. Grievance = under-recognized importance; "we carry the country and are treated as subordinates."

**The portable mechanism:** Same psychology, different vocabulary. In the US, status hierarchy is racial. In Alberta, it's regional and industrial. The horizontal/vertical friction dynamic attaches to whatever hierarchy is locally salient. This is not American exceptionalism — it's a recurring human response to perceived status decline.

**Wesley's populism lens:** Alberta separatism must be understood as part of the *global* rise of right-wing populism, not just a Canadian regional story. The UCP's party structure (PC + Wildrose merger) created the vehicle. The "illegitimate order out to get real Albertans" framing is the same authoritarian populist grammar as Trump, Brexit, Bolsonaro.

**Essay implication:** Wesley is cite-by-name material, not just a footnote source. He bridges empirical data, historical analysis, and real-time commentary. He's at U of A — local credibility. His "Western Alienation 2.0" framing could structure how Alberta is introduced in the essay.

## PERSONAL NARRATIVE FRAME

Max began this project after unproductively arguing with Alberta separatists online using a burner Facebook account. The essay's intellectual argument (horizontal vs. vertical friction) mirrors his personal journey: from horizontal friction (trolling separatists) to vertical analysis (examining power structures).

**The crucial context:** Max is living inside an active separatist movement in real time. Alberta in 2025–2026 is a live case study — a province with genuine economic grievances whose anger has been directed horizontally (at Ottawa, Central Canada, Trudeau) rather than vertically at the structural forces actually responsible.

---

## A NOTE ON AI COLLABORATION HONESTY

A pivotal moment: Max identified a quote in the essay as "too good to be original." It was from Mark Carney. This led to tracing the horizontal/vertical friction concept back to Piven and Cloward. When Max tested Claude's knowledge against another AI's claims about *Poor People's Movements*, Claude expressed appropriate uncertainty while the other AI provided confident but inaccurate details. Max uploaded the actual text — Claude's caution was vindicated.

These moments are not embarrassments. They are the methodology.

## HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT

Max opens each session by saying: **"Check the status doc."**

Claude should then:

**Step 1 — Read this document fully.** Reconstruct the project context before doing anything else.

**Step 2 — Run a quick news scan** on the following topics, in this order:
1. **Alberta separatism** — petition progress, referendum developments, Danielle Smith, Alberta Prosperity Project, Canadian unity
2. **Canadian-US relations** — tariffs, annexation rhetoric, sovereignty, Carney vs. Trump
3. **Vertical friction emerging globally** — any signs of anger turning upward at power structures rather than horizontally at other groups
4. **US political economy** — inequality, institutional collapse, populism, anything directly relevant to the essay's themes
5. **Anything else in the news** that connects to the essay's core argument

**Step 3 — Brief Max on what's new** before asking what the session's task is.

**Step 4 — Ask:** "What are we working on today?"

**Step 5 — End of session:** Update this STATUS.md and push directly to GitHub. The GitHub tool is session-dependent and may not always be available — if it fails, present the file for manual upload. Note: tool availability is unrelated to Max's device.

## POSSIBLE FUTURE PROJECTS

### 🔲 The Billionaire Thriller
*Fictional concept — keep separate from the essay*

A serial killer targeting billionaires. Dramatic tension: the investigator, institutionally obligated to protect the victim class, privately recognizes the victims built the system the essay diagnoses. Could dramatize the essay's central argument in narrative form. Flag for later.

---

## INTELLECTUAL LINEAGE — HORIZONTAL/VERTICAL FRICTION

- **Piven & Cloward, *Poor People's Movements* (1977)** — primary citation
- **Labour organizing tradition** — "don't let the bosses divide us"
- **Marxist theory of false consciousness** — horizontal misdirection as feature of capitalist ideology
- **"Divide and conquer"** — ancient political strategy
- **Lateral oppression literature** — anti-racism and decolonization scholarship

The synthesis across these traditions is the contribution — not the underlying observation.

---

## A FUNDAMENTAL LIMITATION OF THIS COLLABORATION

Claude has no ambient awareness. The Alberta separatist movement — the origin story of this entire project — was invisible until Max mentioned it. Max is not just the director in the symphony conductor sense. He is also the one who carries the ambient context — the world outside the window — and decides what to bring through the door.

**For the methodology manifesto:** This belongs prominently, not as a caveat but as a central truth about what human-AI collaboration actually is.
