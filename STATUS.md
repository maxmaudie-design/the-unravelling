## WHAT THIS PROJECT IS

A long-form essay (currently ~11,200 words) tracing 4,000 years of social contract breakdowns and resets, written to understand contemporary political fracture. Directed by Max Maudie, former journalist, Alberta, Canada. AI collaboration (Claude) is transparent and will be part of the story.

**Publication plan:** Serialized on Substack with "director's commentary" showing the AI collaboration process. Personal framing: "Why I Stopped Trolling Alberta Separatists (And What I Learned About Social Collapse)."

**Core argument:** The "tribalism" and institutional collapse we're experiencing is what happens when a social contract dies and nothing replaces it. Meaningful resets only occur when horizontal friction (groups blaming each other) turns vertical (collective pressure on the system itself).

**The credit model:** The symphony conductor. Max didn't write the individual parts (the scholars did) and didn't play them (the AI did), but conducted the performance into a coherent whole. "Directed by" is accurate and honest.

## OUTSTANDING TASKS (PRIORITY ORDER)

### 🔴 CRITICAL — Must fix before publication
1. **Carney attribution** — The line "Any political project that offers only policy without purpose will lose to one that offers purpose without policy" appears unattributed in V1 and must be properly attributed to **Mark Carney** in V2. Verify exact source before adding.
2. **Trudeau contrast** — "Because it's 2015" to be added as the mirror image: *purpose without policy* vs Carney's *policy without purpose*. These should be contrasted explicitly in the essay.

### 🟡 CONTENT GAPS — Flagged for development
3. **Identity politics section** — Essay may be thin here. The key point: identity replaced geography as the organizing principle of community. V2's Section V touches this but may need more. (From Ideas file.)
4. **Horizontal/vertical friction sourcing** — This concept traces to Piven and Cloward. Essay should acknowledge synthesis rather than claim originality.
5. **Canadian content** — Essay is heavily US-focused. Max's story and Alberta's story are not. Need to work in the Canadian social contract, the equalization system as a social contract mechanism, the Quebec parallel, and Alberta as a live case study. The Carney irony (man whose words appear unattributed in the essay is now PM navigating the very crisis the essay describes) is a narrative gift.

### 🟢 PUBLICATION INFRASTRUCTURE — When essay is clean
6. **Launch post / methodology manifesto** — Publish THIS before the essay. Establishes credibility and honesty upfront. The Carney story is the centrepiece: proof that the collaboration is being done honestly. Roughly 500–1,000 words.
7. **Director's commentary** — See full template below. Accompanies each serialized section.
8. **Mutual interviews** — Max interviews Claude about AI limitations and role; Claude interviews Max about the journey from trolling separatists to understanding their grievances. Companion content to the serialization, not a separate project.
9. **Reading list verification** — Already drafted in V2. Verify all titles, authors, and publication details before publication.

## PUBLICATION STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Clean the Essay
- Attribution audit (Carney fixed; check for anything else)
- Content gaps addressed (identity politics, Piven/Cloward credit, Canadian content)
- Final fact-check on all statistics

### Phase 2: Build the Frame
- Write the methodology manifesto (launch post)
- Draft the "How to Read This" introduction for the essay itself
- Prepare director's commentary for each section using the template below

### Phase 3: Launch
- Publish methodology manifesto first
- Serialize essay weekly, one section per installment
- Each installment = essay section + director's notes
- Comment section becomes part of the collaboration — readers can flag issues

### 🔲 Possible Editorial Angle — The Alberta Hook
"A former Alberta journalist uses 4,000 years of history to understand why his neighbours want to leave Canada."

This framing does several things at once: it gives the essay journalistic urgency (this is happening *now*, Max is inside it), it establishes a different kind of authority than academic expertise (skin in the game, not comfortable remove), and it makes the abstract thesis concrete and human. Consider whether this angle becomes more prominent inside the essay itself — not just in the Substack wrapper — and whether the Alberta separatism movement gets named explicitly as the live case study that prompted the whole project.

## DIRECTOR'S COMMENTARY TEMPLATE

Each Substack installment should follow this format:

```
THE UNRAVELLING — Section [X]: [Title]

[The essay text]

---

DIRECTOR'S NOTES

• What I Asked For: [Max's actual prompts and direction for this section]
• What Surprised Me: [Insights that emerged unexpectedly]
• What I Changed: [Editorial decisions Max made, things he pushed back on]
• What We're Building On: [The scholars being synthesized; direct links]
• Honest Mistakes Caught: [Errors found and corrected — Carney is the model here]
```

The Carney moment is the proof-of-concept for this entire approach. It demonstrates that the collaboration is being done honestly — and it gets more interesting, not less, when mistakes are acknowledged openly.

## KEY INTELLECTUAL DECISIONS MADE

- **Horizontal/vertical friction** is the central analytical framework. Credited to Piven and Cloward as prior scholars; essay presents synthesis, not original discovery.
- **Scope caveat** is explicit: Western-centric, acknowledged as such.
- **Methodology** prioritizes empirical data over narrative. Statistics are used to "read the machine," not assign partisan blame.
- **Nostalgia narrative** is explicitly rejected on both left and right versions.
- **Four futures** framework: techno-feudalism, authoritarian consolidation, new social contract, long muddle.
- Essay resists calling for "restoration" of postwar bargain — its exclusions were features, not bugs.
- **Credit model settled:** "Directed by Max Maudie" — the symphony conductor framing. Not author, not co-author, director.

## PERSONAL NARRATIVE FRAME

Max began this project after unproductively arguing with Alberta separatists online using a burner Facebook account. The project became a way to understand *why* societies fracture — and ended up changing how he sees those neighbours. The essay's intellectual argument (horizontal vs. vertical friction) mirrors his personal journey: from horizontal friction (trolling separatists) to vertical analysis (examining power structures).

This transformation is the spine of the Substack framing. The personal story and the intellectual argument are the same story told at different scales.

**The crucial context:** Max is not writing about separatism and social contract collapse as history. He is living inside an active separatist movement in real time. Alberta in 2025–2026 is a live case study of everything the essay describes — a province with genuine economic grievances (oil revenues, equalization payments, federal overreach) whose anger has been directed horizontally (at Ottawa, at central Canada, at Trudeau, at "elites") rather than vertically at the structural forces actually responsible. The essay's thesis is not abstract from where Max sits. It is the news.

This gives the project a journalistic urgency that pure historical analysis wouldn't have. Max isn't observing the unravelling from a distance. He's embedded in one of its most vivid current expressions. That position — former journalist, living inside the story, trying to understand rather than dismiss his neighbours — is a significant part of what makes this worth reading.

## A NOTE ON AI COLLABORATION HONESTY

A pivotal moment in this project: Max identified a quote in the essay as "too good to be original." It was from Mark Carney. This led to tracing the horizontal/vertical friction concept back to Piven and Cloward — acknowledging synthesis rather than original theory. When Max tested Claude's knowledge against another AI's claims about *Poor People's Movements*, Claude expressed appropriate uncertainty while the other AI provided confident but inaccurate details. Max uploaded the actual text — Claude's caution was vindicated.

These moments are not embarrassments. They are the methodology. They get documented in the director's notes.

## HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT

Max opens each session by saying: **"Check the status doc."**

Claude should then:

**Step 1 — Read this document fully** by fetching it from GitHub: https://github.com/maxmaudie-design/the-unravelling/blob/main/STATUS.md. Reconstruct the project context before doing anything else.

**Step 2 — Run a quick news scan** on the following topics, in this order:
1. **Alberta separatism** — petition progress, referendum developments, Danielle Smith, Alberta Prosperity Project, Canadian unity
2. **Canadian-US relations** — tariffs, annexation rhetoric, sovereignty, Carney vs. Trump
3. **Vertical friction emerging globally** — any signs of anger turning upward at power structures rather than horizontally at other groups (elections, strikes, protests, policy shifts)
4. **US political economy** — inequality, institutional collapse, populism, anything directly relevant to the essay's themes
5. **Anything else in the news** that connects to the essay's core argument

**Step 3 — Brief Max on what's new** before asking what the session's task is. Claude cannot carry ambient awareness between sessions. This news scan is how we compensate for that limitation.

**Step 4 — Ask:** "What are we working on today?"

**Step 5 — End of session:** Push updated STATUS.md back to GitHub.

## POSSIBLE FUTURE PROJECTS

### 🔲 The Billionaire Thriller
*Fictional concept — keep separate from the essay*

A thriller premise seeded in the Ideas file: a serial killer is targeting billionaires. The dramatic tension isn't the killer — it's the investigator, who is institutionally obligated to protect the victim class but privately recognizes that the victims built the system the essay diagnoses. Possible angles: the investigator comes from the rust belt or a hollowed-out community; the killer turns out to be acting on the essay's own logic; the investigator must decide what justice actually means in that context.

This is a way to dramatize the essay's central argument in narrative form. Could work as a standalone fiction project or a companion piece to the Substack. Flag for later — don't conflate with the essay itself.

---

## INTELLECTUAL LINEAGE — HORIZONTAL/VERTICAL FRICTION

The essay's central framework is a synthesis, not an original discovery. Full lineage:

- **Piven & Cloward, *Poor People's Movements* (1977)** — closest scholarly precedent; empirically demonstrates when movements succeed (disruptive vertical pressure on elites) vs. fail (fragmentation, institutionalization, horizontal dissipation)
- **Labour organizing tradition** — "don't let the bosses divide us"; the idea that worker solidarity requires resisting horizontal conflict (race, craft, region) is as old as the labour movement itself
- **Marxist theory of false consciousness** — the idea that the working class is manipulated into identifying with ideological constructs (nationalism, religion, race) rather than their material class interests; horizontal misdirection as a feature of capitalist ideology
- **"Divide and conquer"** — ancient political strategy; documented from Roman military practice onward; the structural version of what the essay describes
- **Lateral oppression literature** — from anti-racism and decolonization scholarship; describes how oppressed groups internalize and reproduce oppression horizontally against each other rather than directing anger at the source

The essay should explicitly acknowledge this lineage rather than presenting the framework as novel. Piven & Cloward are the primary citation. The synthesis across these traditions is the contribution — not the underlying observation.

## A FUNDAMENTAL LIMITATION OF THIS COLLABORATION

Claude has no ambient awareness. A human collaborator — especially a journalist — brings context that seeps into the work without anyone explicitly importing it. They notice things without being told to notice them. Their lived situation is always present.

Claude cannot do this. It has no awareness of anything outside what is placed in front of it in a given conversation. The Alberta separatist movement — the origin story of this entire project — was invisible until Max mentioned it. Not because of poor search habits, but because Claude cannot notice what it hasn't been directed to notice.

This means Max is not just the director in the symphony conductor sense. He is also the one who carries the ambient context — the world outside the window — and decides what to bring through the door. Claude can do a great deal with what it's given. It cannot reach for what it doesn't know is there.

**Practical implication:** At the start of each session, consider what has happened in the world — particularly in Alberta and Canadian politics — that Claude won't know about. That context needs to be explicitly imported.

**For the methodology manifesto:** This belongs prominently, not as a caveat but as a central truth about what human-AI collaboration actually is. The human must carry the ambient world. The AI cannot.
