THE UNRAVELLING — Project Status Document
Updated by Claude at the end of each working session.

February 17, 2026
WHAT THIS PROJECT IS
A long-form essay (currently ~11,200 words) tracing 4,000 years of social contract breakdowns and resets, written to understand contemporary political fracture. Directed by Max Maudie, former journalist, Alberta, Canada. AI collaboration (Claude) is transparent and will be part of the story.
Publication plan: Serialized on Substack with "director's commentary" showing the AI collaboration process. Personal framing: "Why I Stopped Trolling Alberta Separatists (And What I Learned About Social Collapse)."
Core argument: The "tribalism" and institutional collapse we're experiencing is what happens when a social contract dies and nothing replaces it. Meaningful resets only occur when horizontal friction (groups blaming each other) turns vertical (collective pressure on the system itself).
The credit model: The symphony conductor. Max didn't write the individual parts (the scholars did) and didn't play them (the AI did), but conducted the performance into a coherent whole. "Directed by" is accurate and honest.

OUTSTANDING TASKS (PRIORITY ORDER)
🔴 CRITICAL — Must fix before publication
Carney attribution — The line "Any political project that offers only policy without purpose will lose to one that offers purpose without policy" appears unattributed in V1 and must be properly attributed to Mark Carney in V2. Verify exact source before adding.
Trudeau contrast — "Because it's 2015" to be added as the mirror image: purpose without policy vs Carney's policy without purpose. These should be contrasted explicitly in the essay.
🟡 CONTENT GAPS — Flagged for development
Identity politics section — Essay may be thin here. The key point: identity replaced geography as the organizing principle of community. V2's Section V touches this but may need more. (From Ideas file.)
Horizontal/vertical friction sourcing — This concept traces to Piven and Cloward. Essay should acknowledge synthesis rather than claim originality.
Canadian content / Alberta case study — Essay is heavily US-focused. Alberta works as a live case study showing the horizontal/vertical friction dynamic isn't culturally specific to American racial politics. The same status-loss mechanism operates along regional and identity lines in Canada. See research notes below.
Status loss section — The PsyPost study (Feb 17, 2026) and Alberta research together suggest "status loss" deserves explicit treatment as a mechanism, distinct from both economic grievance and pure cultural anxiety. Currently implicit in the essay; could be made explicit in Section V.
🟢 PUBLICATION INFRASTRUCTURE — When essay is clean
Launch post / methodology manifesto — Publish THIS before the essay. Establishes credibility and honesty upfront. The Carney story is the centrepiece: proof that the collaboration is being done honestly. Roughly 500–1,000 words.
Director's commentary — See full template below. Accompanies each serialized section.
Mutual interviews — Max interviews Claude about AI limitations and role; Claude interviews Max about the journey from trolling separatists to understanding their grievances. Companion content to the serialization, not a separate project.
Reading list verification — Already drafted in V2. Verify all titles, authors, and publication details before publication.
PUBLICATION STRATEGY
Phase 1: Clean the Essay
Attribution audit (Carney fixed; check for anything else)
Content gaps addressed (identity politics, Piven/Cloward credit, Canadian content)
Final fact-check on all statistics
Phase 2: Build the Frame
Write the methodology manifesto (launch post)
Draft the "How to Read This" introduction for the essay itself
Prepare director's commentary for each section using the template below
Phase 3: Launch
Publish methodology manifesto first
Serialize essay weekly, one section per installment
Each installment = essay section + director's notes
Comment section becomes part of the collaboration — readers can flag issues
🔲 Possible Editorial Angle — The Alberta Hook
"A former Alberta journalist uses 4,000 years of history to understand why his neighbours want to leave Canada."
This framing does several things at once: it gives the essay journalistic urgency (this is happening now, Max is inside it), it establishes a different kind of authority than academic expertise (skin in the game, not comfortable remove), and it makes the abstract thesis concrete and human. Consider whether this angle becomes more prominent inside the essay itself — not just in the Substack wrapper — and whether the Alberta separatism movement gets named explicitly as the live case study that prompted the whole project.
DIRECTOR'S COMMENTARY TEMPLATE
Each Substack installment should follow this format:
THE UNRAVELLING — Section [X]: [Title]

[The essay text]

---

DIRECTOR'S NOTES

• What I Asked For: [Max's actual prompts and direction for this section]
• What Surprised Me: [Insights that emerged unexpectedly]
• What I Changed: [Editorial decisions Max made, things he pushed back on]
• What We're Building On: [The scholars being synthesized; direct links]
• Honest Mistakes Caught: [Errors found and corrected — Carney is the model here]
The Carney moment is the proof-of-concept for this entire approach. It demonstrates that the collaboration is being done honestly — and it gets more interesting, not less, when mistakes are acknowledged openly.
KEY INTELLECTUAL DECISIONS MADE
Horizontal/vertical friction is the central analytical framework. Credited to Piven and Cloward as prior scholars; essay presents synthesis, not original discovery.
Scope caveat is explicit: Western-centric, acknowledged as such.
Methodology prioritizes empirical data over narrative. Statistics are used to "read the machine," not assign partisan blame.
Nostalgia narrative is explicitly rejected on both left and right versions.
Four futures framework: techno-feudalism, authoritarian consolidation, new social contract, long muddle.
Essay resists calling for "restoration" of postwar bargain — its exclusions were features, not bugs.
Credit model settled: "Directed by Max Maudie" — the symphony conductor framing. Not author, not co-author, director.
Status loss as distinct mechanism — neither pure economic grievance nor pure cultural anxiety, but perceived relative decline in standing. Documented in both US (racial hierarchy) and Alberta (regional hierarchy) contexts. Should be made explicit in Section V.
KEY SOURCES (verified and cited in V2)
Economic Policy Institute — productivity/compensation data
Ira Katznelson, When Affirmative Action Was White — GI Bill racial exclusions
Atif Mian & Amir Sufi, House of Debt — household debt data
Branko Milanovic — elephant chart, Global Inequality
Anne Case & Angus Deaton — deaths of despair
Robert Putnam, Bowling Alone — civic collapse
Bill Bishop, The Big Sort — geographic/ideological sorting; landslide county data
Douglas Rushkoff, Survival of the Richest — elite secession psychology
Yanis Varoufakis, Technofeudalism — platform feudalism
Gabriel Zucman — offshore wealth estimates
Peter Turchin, End Times — elite overproduction model
Shoshana Zuboff, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism
Cass Sunstein — echo chambers and group polarization
New sources identified this session (not yet integrated into V2):
Cooley & Brown-Iannuzzi et al., "White Americans' feelings of being 'last place' are associated with anti-DEI attitudes, Trump support, and Trump vote during the 2024 U.S. presidential election," Advances in Psychology (2026) — peer-reviewed, longitudinal, census-weighted. Key finding: it's perceived racial status position, not objective income/education, that predicts Trump support. 15% of sample fit "last place (tied with Black Americans)" profile. Directly supports Section V's horizontal friction argument with fresh empirical data.
Jared Wesley commissioned paper for Public Order Emergency Commission — traces Alberta separatism and Freedom Convoy to "status loss, political tribalism, and the death of deference to traditional forms of authority." Explicitly names status loss. Also references separate paper: Snagovsky, Maroto & Wesley, "White Identity and Western Alienation in Alberta" (2022).
Tamara Krawchenko, The Conversation (Feb 15, 2026) — "As Alberta separatists court the U.S., prosperity is fuelling a sovereigntist turn." Key line: Alberta's anger "stems from believing it matters a great deal and is nonetheless disrespected." Under-recognized importance, not marginality. Identifies three-way collision: cultivated grievance politics + self-inflicted fiscal vulnerability + energy transition threatening regional identity.
Maclean's, "Alberta's New Separatists" (2025) — concrete data on relative income decline: Alberta median family incomes were 30% above national average before 2014 oil crash, now only 15% above. Still richer, but the gap narrowed. Perceived falling = political fuel.
Common Ground / Samuel Goertz focus group research (2025) — 21 focus groups, 200 Albertans, 4,068km across province. "Joe" (composite typical Albertan) feels overlooked and disrespected specifically by Ontario, Quebec, Vancouver. Not poorer — disrespected. Separatism used as leverage ("Quebec Playbook"), not genuine desire to leave.
RESEARCH NOTES: STATUS LOSS IN ALBERTA
The core paradox: Alberta is objectively Canada's wealthiest province by most measures — highest median incomes, lowest unemployment, fastest growth since 1950. Yet it hosts Canada's most intense separatist movement. This combination is diagnostic: it points to status grievance, not economic grievance.
The mechanism (parallel to PsyPost study):
US finding: White Americans who perceive themselves tied with Black Americans at the bottom of the racial hierarchy (not the actually poorest) are most likely to support Trump. Perceived relative decline, not absolute poverty.
Alberta parallel: Province still richer than rest of Canada, but gap has narrowed since 2014. Experienced as falling. The grievance is under-recognized importance — "we carry the country and are treated as subordinates."
The equalization mechanism: Alberta sends money to Ottawa for redistribution to "have-not" provinces. Experienced not as national solidarity but as being drained to subsidise others. The key status claim: western interests are treated as "regional" while central Canadian interests are treated as "national." Alberta's concerns don't count as Canada's concerns.
The identity dimension: Oil is not just an industry — it's the basis of Alberta's self-image and regional identity. Federal decarbonization policy is heard as: "your identity is a problem to be managed." Status threat becomes existential.
The portable mechanism: The PsyPost study shows status-threat → horizontal anger operating along racial lines in the US. Alberta shows the same mechanism operating along regional/identity lines in Canada. Different vocabulary (not race but region), same underlying psychology. This suggests the horizontal/vertical friction dynamic is not culturally specific — it's a general human response to perceived status decline that attaches to whatever hierarchy is locally salient.
Essay implication: Alberta could serve as the Canadian case study that demonstrates the pattern's portability — and Max's personal position inside it gives it journalistic force that pure American data cannot.
PERSONAL NARRATIVE FRAME
Max began this project after unproductively arguing with Alberta separatists online using a burner Facebook account. The project became a way to understand why societies fracture — and ended up changing how he sees those neighbours. The essay's intellectual argument (horizontal vs. vertical friction) mirrors his personal journey: from horizontal friction (trolling separatists) to vertical analysis (examining power structures).
This transformation is the spine of the Substack framing. The personal story and the intellectual argument are the same story told at different scales.
The crucial context: Max is not writing about separatism and social contract collapse as history. He is living inside an active separatist movement in real time. Alberta in 2025–2026 is a live case study of everything the essay describes — a province with genuine economic grievances (oil revenues, equalization payments, federal overreach) whose anger has been directed horizontally (at Ottawa, at central Canada, at Trudeau, at "elites") rather than vertically at the structural forces actually responsible. The essay's thesis is not abstract from where Max sits. It is the news.
A NOTE ON AI COLLABORATION HONESTY
A pivotal moment in this project: Max identified a quote in the essay as "too good to be original." It was from Mark Carney. This led to tracing the horizontal/vertical friction concept back to Piven and Cloward — acknowledging synthesis rather than original theory. When Max tested Claude's knowledge against another AI's claims about Poor People's Movements, Claude expressed appropriate uncertainty while the other AI provided confident but inaccurate details. Max uploaded the actual text — Claude's caution was vindicated.
These moments are not embarrassments. They are the methodology. They get documented in the director's notes.
HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT
Max opens each session by saying: "Check the status doc."
Claude should then:
Step 1 — Read this document fully. Reconstruct the project context before doing anything else.
Step 2 — Run a quick news scan on the following topics, in this order:
Alberta separatism — petition progress, referendum developments, Danielle Smith, Alberta Prosperity Project, Canadian unity
Canadian-US relations — tariffs, annexation rhetoric, sovereignty, Carney vs. Trump
Vertical friction emerging globally — any signs of anger turning upward at power structures rather than horizontally at other groups (elections, strikes, protests, policy shifts)
US political economy — inequality, institutional collapse, populism, anything directly relevant to the essay's themes
Anything else in the news that connects to the essay's core argument
Step 3 — Brief Max on what's new before asking what the session's task is. Claude cannot carry ambient awareness between sessions. This news scan is how we compensate for that limitation.
Step 4 — Ask: "What are we working on today?"
Step 5 — End of session: Update and upload this STATUS.md file to GitHub (or hand to Max for upload if on mobile).
"The unravelling is the exhale. The reset, if it comes, will be the inhale."
POSSIBLE FUTURE PROJECTS
🔲 The Billionaire Thriller
Fictional concept — keep separate from the essay
A thriller premise: a serial killer is targeting billionaires. The dramatic tension isn't the killer — it's the investigator, who is institutionally obligated to protect the victim class but privately recognizes that the victims built the system the essay diagnoses. Could work as a standalone fiction project or a companion piece to the Substack. Flag for later — don't conflate with the essay itself.
INTELLECTUAL LINEAGE — HORIZONTAL/VERTICAL FRICTION
The essay's central framework is a synthesis, not an original discovery. Full lineage:
Piven & Cloward, Poor People's Movements (1977) — closest scholarly precedent; empirically demonstrates when movements succeed (disruptive vertical pressure on elites) vs. fail (fragmentation, institutionalization, horizontal dissipation)
Labour organizing tradition — "don't let the bosses divide us"
Marxist theory of false consciousness — horizontal misdirection as a feature of capitalist ideology
"Divide and conquer" — ancient political strategy; documented from Roman military practice onward
Lateral oppression literature — from anti-racism and decolonization scholarship
The essay should explicitly acknowledge this lineage. Piven & Cloward are the primary citation. The synthesis across these traditions is the contribution — not the underlying observation.
A FUNDAMENTAL LIMITATION OF THIS COLLABORATION
Claude has no ambient awareness. A human collaborator — especially a journalist — brings context that seeps into the work without anyone explicitly importing it. Claude cannot do this. The Alberta separatist movement — the origin story of this entire project — was invisible until Max mentioned it.
This means Max is not just the director in the symphony conductor sense. He is also the one who carries the ambient context — the world outside the window — and decides what to bring through the door.
For the methodology manifesto: This belongs prominently, not as a caveat but as a central truth about what human-AI collaboration actually is. The human must carry the ambient world. The AI cannot.
